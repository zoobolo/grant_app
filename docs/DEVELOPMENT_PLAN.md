# Grant Management System - Development Plan

## Project Overview
A comprehensive grant management system for airport infrastructure projects, designed to streamline the FAA ADO grant processing workflow. Built with Next.js, PostgreSQL, and Prisma ORM.

## Project Goals
- Streamline grant application and tracking process
- Provide real-time status visibility across all grants
- Automate requirement tracking and document management
- Enable efficient collaboration between Program Managers and Planners
- Support BIL companion grant workflows

## Technical Stack

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (to be implemented)
- **ORM**: Prisma (to be implemented)
- **State Management**: React Query (planned)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js (planned)
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library (planned)

## Session History

| Session | Date | Focus | Status |
|---------|------|-------|--------|
| 01 | 2025-08-29 | UI Mockups & Foundation | In Progress |

## Technical Decisions Log

### 2025-08-29
- **Decision**: UI-first approach with mockups before backend
- **Rationale**: Validate user workflows and requirements before building infrastructure
- **Impact**: Better user experience, reduced rework

- **Decision**: Use session-based development with atomic commits
- **Rationale**: Clear progress tracking, easier rollback if needed
- **Impact**: Better documentation, cleaner git history

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
1. **Pipeline View**: Spreadsheet-style grant listing with filtering and sorting
2. **Grant Detail**: Comprehensive grant management with requirements tracking
3. **New Grant Wizard**: Guided grant creation with validation
4. **Document Management**: Upload, review, and track grant documents
5. **Status Workflow**: Automated status transitions based on requirements

### User Roles
- **Program Manager**: Full grant management capabilities
- **Planner**: Environmental and planning document management
- **Lead**: Oversight and reporting access
- **Manager**: Administrative and review capabilities

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All CRUD operations functional
- [ ] Sub-200ms average response time
- [ ] 80% test coverage
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Role-based access control implemented
- [ ] Document upload/management functional
- [ ] Real-time status updates working

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- PostgreSQL database availability
- Authentication provider setup
- Document storage solution
- Email service for notifications

### Identified Risks
1. **Data Migration**: Existing grant data needs to be imported
2. **Performance**: Large datasets in pipeline view
3. **Integration**: SOAR system connectivity
4. **Security**: Sensitive grant information protection

## Next Milestone
Complete Phase 1 UI mockups with full interaction flows and user validation.
