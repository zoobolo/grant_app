# Session 01: UI Mockups & Foundation
**Date**: 2025-08-29  
**Focus**: Building interactive UI mockups and establishing project foundation

## Session Objectives
Create fully interactive mockups of the three core screens (Pipeline, Grant Detail, New Grant) with mock data to validate user workflows before backend implementation.

## Task Checklist

### Setup & Foundation
- [x] Initialize git workflow with branch structure
- [x] Create documentation framework
- [ ] Set up .gitignore for Next.js
- [ ] Configure TypeScript interfaces for data models

### Mock Data Structure
- [ ] Create grant TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Build mock data generators
- [ ] Set up airport/user reference data
- [ ] Create sample grants with various statuses

### Pipeline View
- [ ] Build main table component
- [ ] Implement filter bar with all criteria
- [ ] Add sorting functionality
- [ ] Create status pill components
- [ ] Implement sticky columns for LOCID/Airport
- [ ] Add row selection and quick actions

### Grant Detail Screen
- [ ] Design header with grant number editing
- [ ] Create information grid layout
- [ ] Build projects section with add/edit/delete
- [ ] Implement requirements checklist
- [ ] Design document management interface
- [ ] Add comments/notes section

### New Grant Form
- [ ] Create multi-step wizard structure
- [ ] Build airport/LOCID selector
- [ ] Implement project builder interface
- [ ] Add BIL companion grant toggle
- [ ] Create cost calculator
- [ ] Add validation displays

### Shared Components
- [ ] Header with navigation
- [ ] Status indicators (phase, status, environmental)
- [ ] Modal system
- [ ] Loading states
- [ ] Empty states
- [ ] Toast notifications

## Design Decisions

### Color Scheme for Status Indicators
- **Planning**: Gray (#f3f4f6)
- **Pre-app**: Blue (#dbeafe)
- **Submitted**: Purple (#e9d5ff)
- **Not Started**: Red (#fee2e2)
- **In Progress**: Yellow (#fef3c7)
- **Documents Needed**: Orange (#fed7aa)
- **Review**: Blue (#dbeafe)
- **Address Comments**: Yellow (#fde68a)
- **Complete**: Green (#d1fae5)

### Navigation Structure
- `/mockups/pipeline` - Main dashboard view
- `/mockups/grant-detail/[id]` - Individual grant details
- `/mockups/new-grant` - Grant creation wizard

## Technical Notes

### Mock Data Strategy
- Use TypeScript interfaces matching Prisma schema
- Generate 50+ sample grants for realistic testing
- Include edge cases (TBD numbers, BIL companions)
- Vary statuses and phases for UI testing

### Component Architecture
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use compound components for complex UI
- Implement controlled components for forms
- Client-side state for mockup phase

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] All filters working correctly
- [ ] Sorting functions properly
- [ ] Forms validate as expected
- [ ] Navigation between screens works
- [ ] Mobile responsive design verified
- [ ] Status transitions demonstrated

## Blockers & Issues
- None currently

## Next Session Prep
- Session 02 will focus on user interaction flows
- Need to implement data persistence (localStorage)
- Add more complex filtering combinations
- Create user preference management

## Commit Log
1. `chore: initialize project with git workflow and documentation structure`
2. `docs: create development plan and session tracking`
3. *(upcoming)* `chore: add comprehensive .gitignore for Next.js`
4. *(upcoming)* `design(types): add TypeScript interfaces for grant system`
5. *(upcoming)* `mockup(pipeline): implement pipeline view with filtering`

## Notes
- Starting with UI-first approach based on user feedback
- Focus on getting visual feedback before backend work
- Using existing HTML wireframes as reference
- Maintaining atomic commits for easy rollback
